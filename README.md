#frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

Customized Version of [Udacity FEND Arcade Game Project](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric).
Extensively customized by Emily Keator (me!) to become a "Rogue One" style arcade game. None of the "Star Wars" franchise
characters belong to me, obviously, or I would be super rich and lying on a beach in Hawaii instead of doing this.

##Instructions
===============================

To run this game, download the zip file, then open index.html. It has only been tested in Chrome as of March '17, so
if you're running [insert other browser here] and hit a bug, my sincerest apologies.

You'll be playing as one of three randomly generated characters from the Rogue One team (Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, or
the droid K2SO). Use your keyboard arrows to navigate up, down, left, and right. You won't be able to fall off the board.

If you collide with an Imperial enemy, you'll be set back at the starting point.

If you collide six times, you will lose--Darth Vader will appear!

If you succeed, the Rebel Alliance will live to fight another day!

May the Force be with you.


###Original Udacity Instructions:

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
